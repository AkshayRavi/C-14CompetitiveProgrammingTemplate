# C-14CompetitiveProgrammingTemplate

C++14 program template for Competive Programming.

Constructs:-

REP(i,n) -> Iterate from i = 0 to n-1
FOR(i,a,b) -> Iterate from i = a to b-1
REPD(i,n) -> Iterate form i = n-1 to 0
FORD(i,a,b) -> Iterate from a to b, in Decreasing Order,[Note: a should be greater than b]
remax(a,b) -> return the maximum of two numbers
remin(a,b) -> return the minimum of two numbers
all(v) => to replace v.begin(),v.end() inside the vector functions
PRECISION(x) -> set pricision of x digits in the flaoting points
FAST_IO -> to desynchronize and utie cin and cout
LCM(a,b) -> return least common multiple
GCD(a,b) -> return least common divisor
EGCD(a,b,&x,&y) -> return least common divisor using Euclid GCD algorithm
